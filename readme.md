🎮 Tic Tac Toe with Minimax AI

This is a classic Tic Tac Toe game where you can play against an AI agent that uses the Minimax algorithm to always make the best possible move. The AI is unbeatable — you can only lose or draw, but never win!

✨ Features

✅ Play Tic Tac Toe against an intelligent AI

🧠 AI decision-making powered by the Minimax algorithm

🎲 Human vs AI gameplay

🎮 Simple and interactive interface (console-based or GUI depending on implementation)

🧩 Demonstrates concepts of game theory and AI in games

🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/anjeetk/tictactoe
   cd tictactoe

2. Run the game

If it’s a Python project:

python runner.py

🧠 How the AI Works (Minimax Algorithm)

The Minimax algorithm is a recursive decision-making strategy used in two-player games:

The AI simulates all possible moves from the current state.

It evaluates outcomes assuming the opponent also plays optimally.

It selects the move that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the opponent’s.

This ensures the AI is always unbeatable.
